      <article id="article-1">
        <p>Upon graduating highschool, I decided I needed to step outside of my comfort zone. Living in Massachusetts my entire life, I realized it was time to flee the proverbial nest of living at home with my parents.</p>
        <p>I left almost all of my possessions behind and ventured off to boot camp in Great Lakes, Illinois all alone. I remembered my recruiter telling me the days would drag on, but the weeks would fly by. Initially I didn't understand what he meant by that. but as I endured the rigors of bootcamp I realized I had understood him completely.</p>
        <p>Upon successfull graduation of Navy bootcamp, I headed to my first permanent duty station in San Diego, California. My first ship was the John A. Moore, FFG-19. I'll never forget stepping onboard the ship for the first time in awe of everything I was seeing. I walked the length of the ship, bow to stern, top to bottom, and I truly felt like a small fish in a big pond. After a few months onboard, we exited the comfort of port in San Diego and headed out for a long 6 month deployment to South America where finally......I was going to see the world like I saw on the television commercials!</p>
        <p>The objective of the South American deployment was for counter-drug operations. We were looking for small, inconspicuous boats that were carrying cocaine and other illegal contraband from Columbia to other parts of the world. Our ship had not made a significant bust in over 10 years, so my expectations were pretty low until one day...</p>
        <p>On this day we boarded a boat floating in the sea that looked like it was being held together by tape. Upon boarding it and lifting several floor boards, 2 metric tons of bailed cocaine were found. We detained the operators of the boat and towed their vessel back through the Panama Canal to Columbia where the detainee's would be handed back over to their country for punishment.</p>
        <p>While we were looking to find narcotics, we still managed to see the world. By the time this 6 month deployment had concluded I had traveled to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Guatamala</li>
            <li>Ecuador</li>
            <li>Panama</li>
            <li>Jamaica</li>
            <li>Costa Rica</li>
            <li>Mexico</li>
            <li>Curacao</li>
        </ul>
         <p>After arriving back to port, our ship was sold to the Turkish Navy and decommisioned. I was now heading to a new ship to finish out my active duty in the Navy.</p>         
         <p>When I arrived to my new ship, it occured to me that this ship was much larger than my previous command. This ship was over 600 feet long! to put this in perspective, imagine two football fields end over end! It took me forever to learn my way around the ship. Getting lost was a daily occurence for quite some time.</p>        
         <p>After a few months acclimating myself, it was back out to sea for another 6 month deployment. This deployment was more stress-free than the previous. We were not looking for drugs. We were simply maintaining foreign relations. Again, it was a lot of work, but by the time it concluded I had traveled to:</p>         
          <ul>
            <li>Hawaii</li>
            <li>Japan</li>
            <li>Thailand</li>
            <li>Singapore</li>
            <li>Malaysia</li>
            <li>Brunei</li>
            <li>Indonesia</li>
            <li>Canada</li>
        </ul>                  
         <p>When we arrived back to the United States I was planning my leave to come home for a week to see my family. One week later the events of 9/11 occured and all that was halted. Instead of going home we were watching President Bush address the nation not knowing how this would affect us. We were confined to the ship as we began training to prepare for hostile environments.</p>                           
         <p>When I reflect back on my time and experiences in the Navy, I hold it with a tremedous amount of reverence. I got to experience a lifestlye that not many people get to experience. We were all truly one large group of brothers and sisters looking out for each other. I would not change a thing when I reflect on my military experience. I love my country and I loved serving my country as well. </p>

				<h1 class="wow fadeIn secondary-header" data-wow-delay="0.2s">Music Career &nbsp;<small> How it all began.......</small></h1>
       			<article id="article-2">		
        			<p>In 1998, I was a senior in high school. I did not possess a single musical bone in my body. I was hanging out with a friend one day, when I saw a guitar in the corner of his room collecting dust. For some reason I was fascinated and asked him if he could play me something. He tried, but he wasn't very good either. Blindly, and with no real rationale, I threw out an offer out of the blue which essentially changed my life.</p>		
       		 		<p>I asked him if I traded him my Super Nintendo and games, if he would let me have the guitar. Fate must have been in the air that day because he agreed to the deal!</p>
        			<p>A much cooler story would be for me to say that I brought the guitar home and it came naturally to me, but the truth is it sat in my room collecting dust for longer than I would care to admit. Soon after, I decided to join the Navy, so I was off to boot camp. The dust continued to accrue on the guitar while I was getting yelled at by drill instructors in boot camp. I had thought that when boot camp ended, I would go home and grab the guitar and teach myself to play while I was in the Navy. I figured that being on a boat floating in the middle of the ocean would leave me with quite a bit of free time to learn.</p>
        			<p>In 1999, the internet was not something that was very accessible to everyone so I had to teach myself guitar with little resources. There were some painful moments for sure, and I'm sure my shipmates cringed at times when hearing me teaching myself.</p>       
        			<p>Days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months and I realized I was getting better! Now it became an obsession to the point my social life even suffered a bit. While everyone else was out having a good time, I was teaching myself Hendrix and Pink Floyd. I figured that was a good place to start.</p>       
         			<p>When I got out of the military, I was decent enough to write my own songs and attempt to put a band together. I formed a heavy metal band known as Hostile Takeover. This was everything I ever wanted. We gained enough steam to start playing some desired Boston venues such as the Paradise, the Middle East, and our favorite spot which was Goodtimes in Somerville.</p>
         			<p>After Hostile Takeover finished up, I wanted to expand my musical knowledge. I joined the popular Boston based cover band Random Axis. I was now playing 3-4 hours a night and actually getting paid! From there I moved on to an even more musically demanding cover band. This was the North Shore's finest cover and wedding band Wildfire. Now instead of playing rock all night, I was playing disco, funk, soundtrack, big band, top 40, and classic rock. I really grew as a musician during this time.</p>         
         			<p>Eventually I got burnt out on the late nights and playing other people's music. I decided it was time for a change. I started teaching guitar out of my home and it was pretty amazing. I gained valuable teaching skills and met some great people. When I wasn't teaching, I began writing music on my own. It was at this point that I realized I needed to teach myself audio engineering. I used to be very intimidated when it came to terms like "frequencies", "mixing", and "mastering", but I was suddenly hooked and could not learn fast enough. As I was learning, it wasn't uncommon for me to sit in front of my computer for sometimes 10 hours straight making little tweaks to the audio. It truly was like art, but in a musical form.</p>         
         			<p>I'm available for any audio engineering needs you may be in need of. This could be anything from:</p>       
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vocal Tracking</li>
                        <li>Guitar Tracking</li>
                        <li>Bass Tracking</li>
                        <li>Drum Programming</li>
                        <li>Synth/Midi Programming</li>
                        <li>EQ'ing</li>
                        <li>Mixing</li>
                        <li>Mastering</li>
                        <li>Full Conversion to High Quality MP3</li>
                   </ul>                 
         			<p>I also have a few openings for new students that wish to continue learning guitar and take their abilities to the next level.
